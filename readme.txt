StatPress is the free plug-in for WordPress dedicated to the management of statistics about blog visits.


== Description ==

Once the plugin StatPress has been activated it immediately starts to collect the unlogged blog visitors.
In the Dashboard menu you will find the StatPress page where you could look up the statistics.
StatPress also includes a widget one can possibly add to a sidebar.

Una volta attivato il plugin StatPress inizia subito a memorizzare i visitatori non loggati al blog. Nel menu Dashboard trovate la pagina StatPress dove consultare le statistiche.
StatPress include anche un widget personalizzabile da inserire eventualmente in una sidebar.

== Installation ==

Upload wp-statpress directory in /wp-content/plugins/ . Then just activate it on your plugin management page.
StatPress creates the database table automatically.

Update

Upload new wp-statpress version. In the Dashboard click "StatPressUP" menu. You are ready!
"StatPressUP" will update your database content if you edit the "def" files (to add a new OS, browser,É). If you have some new useful definition, please share it!
